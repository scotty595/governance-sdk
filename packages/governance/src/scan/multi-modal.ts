/**
 * governance-sdk — Multi-Modal Scan Orchestration
 *
 * The SDK's injection cascade scans text. Image, PDF, and audio content
 * blocks pass through it untouched unless something extracts text first.
 * This file ships the orchestration; the actual extractors (OCR, PDF
 * parsing, ASR) are caller-supplied via `registerModalityScanner` so
 * the SDK stays zero-runtime-dep.
 *
 * **Opt-in by default.** Every modality except `text` is OFF unless the
 * caller enables it explicitly. Reasons:
 *   - Cost: OCR / Whisper inference per request is non-trivial.
 *   - Latency: extraction adds 100ms–10s depending on payload + tool.
 *   - Privacy: some customers cannot have payload content read by
 *     anything other than the model itself.
 *
 * **Wiring with the existing cascade:**
 *   1. Caller registers extractors at startup:
 *      `registerModalityScanner('image', { extractText: ... })`
 *   2. Per request, caller invokes `scanMultiModal(blocks, { enabled: ['text','image'] })`
 *      BEFORE `gov.enforce()`.
 *   3. The returned `text` is the concatenation of all scanned blocks. Run
 *      it through `detectInjection()` / `hybridDetect()` and populate
 *      `ctx.mlInjectionScore` as usual.
 *   4. If `result.failClosed` is true, fail closed — set the score to
 *      1.0 or block out-of-band. The flag is pre-evaluated against the
 *      `onMissingScanner` / `onExtractError` options you passed to
 *      `scanMultiModal`. Use `isFailClosed(result, override)` only if
 *      you want to apply a different policy after the fact.
 *
 * Mirrors the InjectionClassifier pattern in `injection-classifier.ts` —
 * same async hook + global registry + pre-`enforce()` invocation shape.
