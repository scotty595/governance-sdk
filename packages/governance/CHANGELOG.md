# Changelog

## [Unreleased] — Kernel and plugins: the restructure

Splits the SDK into a kernel and the things that attach to it. Nothing about
the public API changes: every existing export, subpath and behaviour is
unchanged, and the full suite passes without a single test being rewritten to
accommodate the move. See `docs/restructure-plan.md`.

### Changed — the package split (phase B)

- **Four packages.** `@governance-sdk/core` (the kernel, depends on nothing),
  `@governance-sdk/plugins` (extensions), `@governance-sdk/adapters`
  (framework adapters and the Agent Hooks surface), and `governance-sdk`, the
  meta-package you install. The three scoped packages are `private: true`
  under a placeholder scope; nothing new is publishable and renaming the scope
  is one find-and-replace. All 48 subpaths 0.22.0 shipped keep working
  through compatibility shims that say which package now owns each, and the
  five phase A added (`plugin`, `conformance/agent-hooks`, `ext/*`) resolve
  the same way.
- **The kernel imports nothing from the extension layer.** Every layering
  exception is gone: detection conditions, the sensitive-data evaluator and
  its masker, tool-result scanning, the modality gate, and scoring all left
  core. `createGovernanceKernel()` builds a bare kernel; `createGovernance()`
  is that plus `defaultExtensions()`. `KernelExtensions` is deliberately
  synchronous, unlike the plugin contract: a built-in condition must work on
  the first `enforce()`, and `register()` returns a score, so neither can wait
  on a promise.
- **Scoring is a kernel extension.** A bare kernel's `register()` returns
  level 0 labelled "Unscored" with an empty `dimensions` array — which cannot
  be misread as a scorer that ran and found zeros — and `score()` /
  `scoreFleet()` throw `NoScorerError` rather than returning `null` or an
  empty summary, both of which already mean something else.
- **The layering lint compares imports against declared dependencies**, per
  package, rather than paths. It catches a dependency that only resolves
  because npm hoisted it, and a test reaching across a boundary its package
  does not declare. The scanner ignores comments and template literals; its
  first run reported fifty violations that were `import` lines inside JSDoc
  examples and the CLI's scaffold.
- `tsconfig.base.json` holds the shared compiler settings; `tsc -b` builds the
  packages in dependency order; `npm ci` → build → lint → test verified
  against a clean tree.
- **The published tarball is self-contained.** `npm run pack` stages the
  three private packages inside `governance-sdk`'s tarball, because npm does
  not bundle workspace links (declaring `bundleDependencies` alone yields a
  package that installs and then fails on first `import`). `npm run
  verify-pack` installs that tarball into a fresh project and imports every
  subpath; CI and the release workflow run it, and the release publishes the
  tarball rather than `npm publish -w`. An API-surface diff of every subpath
  against 0.22.0 (`scripts/api-surface.mjs`) showed no runtime export removed
  and one dropped type export at the root, `FailModes`, now restored.

### Added — new surface (phase C)

- **Claude Agent SDK adapter** (`governance-sdk/plugins/claude-agent`).
  `canUseTool` and the `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` hooks decide every tool
  call at the `process` stage and scan every tool result; a refusal is
  returned as the SDK's own deny rather than thrown into its error path.
  `preprocess()` / `postprocess()` are functions for the host's prompt and
  final answer, since the SDK exposes no hook for those. The SDK is not
  vendored, so the types describe its documented surface; a mismatch is a
  compile error in `query({ options })`, never a bypass.
- **Cloudflare Agents adapter** (`governance-sdk/plugins/cloudflare-agents`).
  Wraps AI-SDK-shaped tools' `execute`; `needsApproval(tool, input)` is a
  predicate for Cloudflare's confirmation prompt and is deliberately not
  auto-attached, because a chat confirmation is not the governance approval.
  Web-standard only, asserted by a test that walks the import graph.
  `AgentFramework` gains `"cloudflare"`.
- **Adapter kernel: `decide()` and `notify()`.** `enforce()` fires the
  outcome callbacks then throws; `enforceStage()` does neither; three
  verdict-returning seams (`canUseTool`, the hook, Agent Hooks `preTool`)
  each wanted callbacks without the throw and had reimplemented it. One
  dispatch now owns which callback fires for which outcome.
- **Three standards mappings** as modules and plugins: NIST AI 600-1
  (`governance-sdk/nist-ai-600-1`: 19 subcategories with the twelve §2 GAI
  risks rolled up; bias and environmental impact by attestation), CSA AI
  Controls Matrix v1.1 (`governance-sdk/csa-aicm`: 18 domains enumerated, 10
  scored, no individual control objective assessed because the spreadsheet is
  gated, and the report says so) and IMDA's agentic framework
  (`governance-sdk/imda-agentic`: v1.0, 17 requirements; v1.5 of May 2026 is
  not yet diffed). `allStandardsPlugins()` returns seven. The NIST AI RMF
  report's `scope` now points at the 600-1 mapping instead of calling it
  roadmap.
- **Externally issued identity.** `governance-sdk/identity-jwt` verifies
  RS256, ES256 and EdDSA JWTs on Web Crypto with the algorithm fixed by the key
  material (`HS*` and `none` cannot be enabled); `createJwksResolver()` is
  bounded by key cap, TTL, per-`kid` cooldown, a refetch budget and request
  coalescing. `governance-sdk/identity-spiffe` adds strict SPIFFE ID parsing
  and JWT-SVID verification. `governance-sdk/ext/identity` registers a
  verifier under `gov.getVerifier("identity")` that returns the exact context
  fields `require_signed_identity` reads and writes an `identity_verification`
  audit event carrying the delegation chain. X.509-SVIDs are not verified.
- **`VerifierRegistry`.** `registerVerifier()` and `getVerifier()` are typed
  through an open interface the registering plugin augments by declaration
  merging, so importing the identity plugin is what makes
  `getVerifier("identity")` typed. The kernel never imports a plugin's types.
- Eight new subpaths, 60 export paths in total after the removal below. 2,099 tests.

### Removed

- **`governance-sdk/token-types`.** The Propolis → Honeycomb JWT shapes were
  the internal contract of one Lua product, never used by the SDK, never
  tested, and never an SDK concern; they are removed outright rather than
  deprecated. Anyone who needs that token verified has it already: it is an
  RS256 JWT with the agent id in `sub`, so `verifyJwt(token, {
  capabilitiesClaim: "allowedTools", expectedIssuer, expectedAudience })` from
  `governance-sdk/identity-jwt` covers it with the issuer's public key.

### Added

- **A plugin contract.** `gov.use(plugin)` / `unuse(id)` / `plugins()` /
  `report(id, config)`. A plugin declares `{ id, version, requires, install,
  uninstall }` and receives a `KernelHandle` — `registerCondition`,
  `registerMaskStrategy`, `registerVerifier`, `registerReporter`, `addSink`,
  the event stream, an audit writer and `failModes()` — and never the
  instance, its storage or its rules. Installation is idempotent per id and
  refuses a plugin whose `requires.core` range the kernel does not satisfy
  (a dependency-free semver subset whose caret pins the minor below 1.0.0,
  which is what a 0.x kernel needs).
- **Every register verb returns a disposer**, and the registry records them
  per plugin, so `unuse()` rolls a plugin back in full without the author
  tracking anything — including restoring a built-in condition the plugin
  overrode. A plugin's own `uninstall()` is now only for what the kernel never
  saw. This came directly from the contract's first consumer, which could not
  write an honest `uninstall()` against the first draft.
- **Standards, scoring and detection ship as plugins**:
  `governance-sdk/ext/{standards,scoring,detect}`. Each standards plugin
  carries the revision it implements as its version, so OWASP's annual
  revision and a regulator moving a date stop being kernel releases. The
  direct exports (`mapToEuAiAct`, `assessAgent`, `detectInjection`) are
  unchanged and additive.
- **Agent Hooks conformance**: `governance-sdk/conformance/agent-hooks`
  implements all eight interception points of the framework-neutral contract,
  so a runtime that speaks it can drive this SDK. The contract's two lossy
  edges are stated in the mapping: `require_approval` becomes a deny carrying
  its approval id and poll URL, and `warn` becomes an allow carrying an
  annotation.
- **A shared adapter kernel.** `createAdapterCore` / `attachAdapterCore` own
  registration, context assembly, enforcement, audit, provenance and the
  enforce-run-audit wrapper. Every adapter now also gets consequence tiers
  (`toolTiers`), taint propagation, and target path and URL extraction from
  tool arguments — capabilities only the Mastra processor had.
- **A layering lint** (`scripts/check-layering.mjs`, in `npm run lint`)
  enforcing that core imports neither adapters nor ext, by logical membership
  rather than by directory, so the rule bites before the packages exist. Eight
  real violations are recorded with the phase that removes each; the lint fails
  on a new one and on an exception that no longer matches a real import.
- `InjectionDetectorConfig.patterns` replaces the built-in corpus outright,
  which is what a caller swapping in their own detector needs;
  `customPatterns` still adds to it. `extractStrings` is exported so an
  overriding condition uses the same input walk as the built-in.

### Fixed

- **`verifyAuditIntegrity` and `AuditIntegrity.verify` threw a `TypeError` on
  a sparse, null-holed or undated chain** instead of reporting a break. A
  verifier that crashes on a tampered export is indistinguishable from one
  with no opinion. Both now return a break at the offending index.
- Nine adapters' private scaffolds are gone — eight copies of
  `buildRegistration`, nine each of `createEnforcer` and `createAuditor`, four
  of `createResultScanner`, six of `contentToText`, seven of
  `extractLastUserText`, six of `replaceLastUserText`, 851 lines in all. That
  duplication is what let nine adapters drift onto `agentLevel: 0`.
- The ReDoS guard asserted a wall-clock budget, which measured machine
  contention as much as the code and failed only under a loaded suite. It now
  asserts that cost stays linear in input size, which survives load and fails
  on a quadratic pattern even on fast hardware.

### Changed

- `index.ts` split into `audit-chain.ts`, `scoring-hooks.ts` and
  `fail-modes.ts` (1,141 lines to 869). `packages/governance/src/plugins/`
  gained `adapter-core.ts` and `text-extract.ts`.
- `noUnusedLocals` is on. Every adapter file is under the 300-line rule,
  including the three that were over it.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-09-04 — Kernel hardening, fail-closed defaults, tiers and provenance

Closes the four high-severity findings from the September 2026 review and the
medium ones behind them, then adds the controls the roadmap's second block
asked for. Every guarantee below is asserted by a named test; see
`docs/guarantees.md`.

Released on GitHub (tag `v0.22.0`); **npm publishing is paused**, so the
registry still serves 0.20.0. 0.21.0 was never tagged or published on its own
and is superseded by this release, which contains it. See *Releasing* in
CONTRIBUTING.md for how versions are cut and how npm publishing is switched
back on.

### Security

- **Kill switch covered every stage in the README but only the `process`
  stage in code.** Kill rules are now *system rules*: stage-agnostic
  (`enforcePreprocess`, `enforceToolResult` and `enforcePostprocess` all
  block a killed agent), not removable through `gov.removeRule()`, and in
  hosted mode evaluated locally *before* the remote API is called, so a
  local kill cannot be undone by a remote allow. Previously `kill()` in
  hosted mode changed nothing the API consulted.
- **Priority-clamp escape closed.** Any rule whose id began with `__` skipped
  the 998 clamp, so a YAML rule `id: __x, priority: 1000, outcome: allow`
  outranked the kill switch. System rules are now tracked in a private set
  populated only by `addSystemRule()`; all user rules are clamped, no opt-out.
- **ReDoS in the injection detector.** `excessive_spacing` was quartic (a
  512-character `aaa…    bbb…` input took 36 s; 6 KB blocked the event loop
  for minutes); `unicode_homoglyph`, `markdown_injection`, `override_system`,
  `persist_override`, `future_sessions`, `forced_tool_call`,
  `agent_worm_propagation`, `authority_claim_override`, `new_role_unrestricted`
  and `base64_payload` had quadratic-or-worse tails, as did the
  `email_address` sensitive pattern. All 56 injection and 27 sensitive-data
  patterns are now bounded, linear-time regexes; 50 KB adversarial inputs
  that took 4–10 s (or minutes) take under 10 ms, benign 50 KB prose is
  unchanged at ~4 ms. `injection-redos.test.ts` times every pattern against
  pathological shapes under a 150 ms budget. `markdown_injection` no longer
  requires the closing `)`; `excessive_spacing` requires both gaps within
  500 characters on one line.
- **HMAC identity token expiry was unsigned.** `agent-identity` tokens are now
  v2: the signature covers every claim including `expiresAt`, comparison is
  constant-time, secrets must be ≥ 16 bytes, and v1 tokens are rejected —
  re-issue outstanding HMAC tokens after upgrading. The module is deprecated
  in favour of `agent-identity-ed25519`.
- **Mask failed open at the preprocess stage.** Adapters put prompt text under
  `input.message` while the engine masked `input.prompt`, so a `mask` rule
  returned `outcome: "mask"` with no `maskedText` and the original reached
  the LLM. The engine now reads `inputText`, then `input.message` / `prompt`
  / `text`, and when no redaction can be computed it degrades the decision
  to `block` with `degradedFrom: "mask"`. `sensitive_data_filter` scans the
  same text sources, so an SSN in a prompt can be masked before the model.
- **Rules are validated at every entry point.** `createGovernance()`,
  `addRule()`, `createPolicyEngine()` and `fromYAML()` reject a misspelled
  outcome or stage, a non-finite priority, an unregistered condition type, an
  uncompilable regex or a malformed nested condition with
  `PolicyValidationError`. The YAML loader no longer turns `- "http://x"`
  into an object (which silently weakened allow/block lists) and refuses
  `__proto__` / `constructor` / `prototype` keys.
- **Ed25519 verification hardened.** Optional `aud` / `iss` claims with
  `expectedAudience` / `expectedIssuer`; replay rejection via a pluggable
  `IdentityReplayStore` (`createMemoryReplayStore()` shipped); key rotation
  via `pinnedPublicKeysHex` or `resolvePublicKey(kid)`; typed failure
  reasons. `verifyCertificate()` can now verify delegated certificates
  against the issuer key (they were unverifiable before); `delegate()`
  refuses an expired parent.
- **Empty integrity signing keys are rejected**; keys under 16 characters
  warn (and are rejected under `strict`).
- **Nine adapters hard-coded `agentLevel: 0`**, so `requireLevel(1)` blocked
  every call through Anthropic, OpenAI Agents, MCP, Genkit, LlamaIndex,
  Mistral, Ollama, Bedrock and LangChain while Mastra and Vercel passed. All
  adapters now carry the level `register()` returned; `adapter-parity.test.ts`
  asserts identical outcomes across all ten.

### Added

- **Session ledger.** In local mode the instance keeps per-session action
  timestamps, token and cost totals and fills `recentActionTimestamps`,
  `recentActionCount`, `sessionTokensUsed` and `sessionCost` on the context
  before evaluation, so `rateLimit(n, windowMs)` finally honours its window
  and `tokenBudget()` / `costBudget()` accumulate from
  `recordOutcome({ tokensUsed, cost })`. Host-supplied values win. Configure
  or disable with `ledger`. `ActionOutcome` gains `cost` and `metadata`.
- **Consequence tiers.** `ctx.actionTier` (`read` / `reversible` /
  `external` / `irreversible`), the `action_tier` condition and
  `requireTierApproval(tiers)`. The Mastra processor maps tools with
  `toolTiers`.
- **Provenance (taint).** `ctx.taint: TaintMark[]`, the `tainted_input`
  condition, `blockTaintedTools(tools, opts)`, and helpers `markTaint`,
  `hasTaint`, `appendTaint`. `scanToolResult()` returns a mark for every
  ingestion (`suspicious` when the detector fired) and accepts prior marks;
  the Mastra processor records marks in Mastra's per-request processor state
  and carries them on subsequent tool calls (`trackTaint`, default on).
- **`toolResultInjectionGuard()`** — the first shipped preset at the
  `tool_result` stage. `mlInjectionGuard()` accepts `stage`. The detector's
  score is now `ctx.injectionScore` (`mlInjectionScore` kept as an alias).
- **Decisions that teach.** Every decision carries `stage`, `condition.type`
  and, for built-ins, a one-line `remedy`.
- **Explicit fail modes.** `strict: true` flips `fallbackMode` and
  `integrityAudit.onFailure` to `block`; `gov.failModes()` reports the
  resolved behaviour; `logger` prints it once at construction and receives
  warnings (weak key, hosted-mode local audit writes).
- **Events and metrics wired in.** `gov.events` emits `enforcement`,
  `registration`, `policy_added`, `policy_removed`, `kill`, `revive`;
  `gov.metrics` counts enforcement outcomes and registrations and times
  enforcement.
- **Stable `agentId`** on every registering adapter, forwarded to
  `gov.register({ id })`, so restarts reuse the agent row.
- **Vercel streaming is incremental.** `wrapStreamWithGovernance` is a
  pull-based stream: `per-chunk` emits after one chunk (first-chunk latency
  505 ms → 101 ms on a 5 × 100 ms source), `sliding` after the lookback
  window, `buffered` unchanged. Backpressure is respected and a block cancels
  the source. LanguageModelV1 `textDelta` parts are scanned too.
- `getAuditIntegrityBatch` on the storage contract (memory and Postgres
  adapters implement it), removing the N+1 read from `integrityChain.export()`.
- `docs/guarantees.md`, `docs/threat-model.md`, `docs/remote-contract.md`,
  `docs/restructure-plan.md`.
- `audit-chain-truncation.test.ts` asserts the documented limit that tail
  truncation is not detectable (thanks to the reader of issue #3).

### Changed

- The remote enforcer validates the decision shape (a malformed response is a
  transport failure resolved by `fallbackMode`), retries 408 / 425 / 429 with
  `Retry-After`, throws only on 401 / 403, and resolves other 4xx by
  `fallbackMode` instead of throwing. New `onFallback` and `redactInput`
  options. The wire contract is documented in `docs/remote-contract.md`.
- Hosted mode warns once (via `logger` and `onAuditError`) that
  `audit.log()`, `recordOutcome()` and kill-switch events write to local
  storage, not the API.
- Imported HMAC keys are cached (bounded), removing ~35 µs per chained event.
- **Normalisation.** A `\p{Cf}` strip replaces the hand-maintained zero-width
  list (closes the Tag-character, LRM/RLM, word-joiner and soft-hyphen
  bypasses); combining marks and variation selectors attached to Latin letters
  are removed (`iǵnore`); the confusable map now covers IPA small capitals,
  more Cyrillic and Greek, and Armenian. Obfuscation-category patterns also run
  on the raw input — `zero_width_chars`, `fullwidth_latin`, `uncommon_spaces`
  and `homoglyph_ignore` had been dead since NFKC normalisation was introduced
  and fire again. The phrase corpus is documented as English-only. LIB regex
  baseline F1 0.492 → 0.505 (committed baseline regenerated).
- **Sensitive-data patterns are precision-gated.** `SensitivePattern.validate`
  hook; `luhnValid` and `matchesSensitivePattern` exported. `aws_secret`
  requires a secret label within 40 characters or an `AKIA…` id within 120
  (git SHA-1s are no longer redacted); `credit_card` is Luhn-checked;
  `phone_us` requires `+1`, `(xxx)` or full separators; `ip_address` requires
  octets ≤ 255 and skips version strings; the `email_address` `[A-Z|a-z]`
  typo is fixed. `maskSensitiveData` matches every pattern against the
  original text and merges overlapping spans (adjacent hits collapse into one
  `[REDACTED]`).
- `package.json` declares `"sideEffects": false`.
- README: "any deletion breaks verification" narrowed to *interior* deletion;
  constant-time claim widened to identity tokens; approval flow marked
  hosted-only; kill-switch, preset, adapter and Vercel sections rewritten to
  match behaviour.

### Breaking-ish (pre-1.0)

- Rules with unknown condition types are rejected when added, not when first
  evaluated. Register custom conditions before adding rules that use them.
- `mask` with no computable redaction is now `block`, not a pass-through.
- `agent-identity` v1 tokens no longer verify; secrets under 16 bytes throw.
- A token carrying `aud` will not verify unless the verifier passes
  `expectedAudience`.
- `rateLimit()` now actually limits in local mode. Hosts that relied on it
  being inert should pass `ledger: false` or supply their own counts.
- **Standards mappings corrected.** EU AI Act deadlines follow Reg. (EU)
  2026/1744: Annex III high-risk obligations 2027-12-02 (was hard-coded
  2026-08-02), Annex I 2028-08-02, Art 50 transparency 2026-08-02 (was
  wrongly 2025-08-02). `ComplianceReport` gains required `regulationRevision`,
  `annex` and new `phasedDeadlines` keys (`gpaiModelObligations`,
  `article50Transparency`, `annexIIIHighRisk`, `annexIHighRisk`); the old keys
  remain as deprecated aliases. Assessment config accepts `annex` and `asOf`.
  The OWASP module adopts the official Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026:
  `risks[].id` is `ASI01`–`ASI10` (was `OWASP-AA-0x`, kept as `legacyId`),
  requirement ids are `asiNN-*` (were `aaNN-*`), titles are the official
  ones, and the report carries `standard`, `revision`, `publishedOn`,
  `sourceUrl` and a `coverageMatrix`.
- Hosted mode: non-auth 4xx responses no longer throw; they resolve by
  `fallbackMode`. `status().mode` is `"fallback"` after any fallback decision
  even when the API answered.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-08-26 — Independent maintenance, `demo` command

governance-sdk is now maintained independently at
https://github.com/scotty595/governance-sdk by its original author. The code
was developed at Lua and published from `lua-ai-global/governance` through
0.20.0; the MIT license and Lua's copyright notice on that work are unchanged.
The npm package name, every import path, and the public API are unchanged.

### Added

- `npx governance-sdk demo` — a zero-setup walkthrough that runs entirely
  in-process (no network, no API key, nothing written to disk, under a
  second). It registers an agent, enforces three tool calls (`allow` /
  `block` / `require_approval`), pre-scans a prompt-injection attempt,
  masks a leaked connection string and SSN in a model response, then exports
  the HMAC audit chain and shows that an edited or deleted event fails
  `verifyAuditIntegrity()`. `runDemo(print, { color })` in `cli/demo.ts`
  returns every decision so the scenario is covered by tests. From a clone,
  `npm run demo` at the repository root runs the same thing.
- `npx governance-sdk --help` / `-h` / `help` now print usage and exit 0
  (previously reported "Unknown command" and exited 1).
- **Mastra processor implements the native `processToolResult` hook**
  (`@mastra/core` ≥ 1.57.0, [mastra-ai/mastra#16012](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/16012)).
  Tool returns are scanned at the `tool_result` stage automatically, through
  the same `scanToolResult()` path `wrapTool` uses, so rules behave
  identically whichever path delivers the result. Block / require_approval →
  the result is replaced with `{ blocked: true, reason, ruleId }` via
  `messageList.updateToolInvocation` (default, `toolResultBlockMode:
  "substitute"`) or the run is tripwired (`"abort"`, honoring
  `retryOnBlock` / `maxRetries`); mask → the redacted text replaces the
  result. Mastra re-reads the message list after the hook, so the next LLM
  turn and streaming clients both see the processed value. Provider-executed
  results (e.g. Anthropic `web_search`) are scanned too.
  - New config: `toolResultBlockMode`, `onToolResultBlocked`, `onToolResult`.
    `metadataProvider` and `onApprovalRequired` now receive stage
    `"tool_result"`; `getStats().toolResults` counts scanned / blocked /
    masked.
  - Tools wrapped with `wrapTool` / `wrapTools` are remembered and skipped by
    the hook, so integrations that upgrade Mastra without removing their
    wrap calls don't double-scan or double-audit.
  - Older Mastra versions never call the method; `wrapTool` / `wrapTools`
    remain the path there. New types: `ProcessToolResultArgs`,
    `MastraToolResultInfo`, `MastraMessageListLike`, `MastraToolInvocationPart`.

### Changed

- Package metadata (`repository`, `bugs`, `homepage`, `author`) points at
  the new repository; Lua AI, Inc. is listed under `contributors`. The same
  metadata change ships in `governance-sdk-platform` 0.1.4 (metadata only).
- Mastra `GovernanceProcessor.name` is `"Governance Processor"` (was
  `"Lua Governance Processor"`). Only visible in logs/traces that print the
  processor name.
- CycloneDX SBOM default `metadata.tools[].vendor` is `"governance-sdk"`
  (was `"Lua"`). Override with the `tool` option as before.
- CLI `init` scaffold header, help text, and docs links point at the new
  repository. Releases are published with npm provenance attestations.
- README: hosted mode is documented vendor-neutrally (`serverUrl` targets
  any server implementing the remote-enforcer contract; Lua Governance Cloud
  is one implementation and is not part of this repo); comparison claims are
  hedged and dated; "12 framework integrations" is clarified as 12
  integration modules across 11 frameworks.
- Mastra processor: `scanToolResults` and `toolResultScans` now gate the
  `processToolResult` hook as well as the `wrapTool` / `wrapTools` helpers.

### Unchanged, deliberately

- Postgres default table prefix `lua_gov` — renaming it would break existing
  databases. Set `tablePrefix` if you want a different one.
- The Lua Injection Benchmark (LIB) dataset name and files.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-08-08 — Tool-name approval gating (`requireToolApproval`)

Adds a first-class preset for requiring human approval on specific *tools*.
`requireApproval(actions)` gates action *categories* (`ctx.action`); the new
`requireToolApproval(tools)` gates individual tools by name (`ctx.tool`) —
completing the tool-name condition family (`blockTools`, `allowOnlyTools`)
for the `require_approval` outcome.

### Added

- `tool_match` built-in condition — outcome-neutral membership test on
  `ctx.tool` (the same matching `tool_blocked` uses, without the block-list
  framing). Stage default: `process`.
- `requireToolApproval(tools, reason?)` preset — builds a
  `tool_match` rule with outcome `require_approval`, priority 80. Exported
  from the package root and `governance-sdk/policy` alongside the other
  presets.

### Notes

- `requireApproval(actions)` is unchanged — it remains the preset for
  action categories (`"payment"`, `"database_mutation"`, …). A `tool_call`
  whose tool name coincides with an action-type string still does not match
  `action_type` rules.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-20 — DB-backed integrity chain stats (multi-process truth)

Completes the multi-process hardening from 0.18.2. That release made the audit
integrity chain's *writes* atomic against the durable per-org head and made
`export()` / `verifyAuditIntegrity()` read durable state. `integrityChain.stats()`
was the one reader left on process-local state — it returned this process's
last-written `sequence` / `lastHash` from an in-closure cache, so under a
multi-process deployment (replicas, `pm2` cluster, serverless) it lagged writes
made by other processes sharing the store. This release makes `stats()` read the
durable head too, so all three readers agree on the true tip.

### Changed — `integrityChain.stats()` is DB-backed and now async (BREAKING-ISH)

- `stats(organizationId?)` reads `storage.getChainHead(organizationId)` fresh on
  every call whenever the adapter provides it (the memory and Postgres adapters
  do), returning the true durable `latestSequence` / `latestHash` — including
  writes from other processes — instead of a process-local cache. It does not
  mutate chain state; the write path still owns the per-org head under its lock.
- Because the durable read is a storage round-trip, the method is now `async`:
  it returns `Promise<{ latestSequence; latestHash; algorithm }>` (was a plain
  object ≤0.18.x). Callers must `await` it. This is the same sync→durable shift
  0.12.0 made for the chain itself; the return shape is otherwise unchanged (no
  new fields).
- Adapters with no `getChainHead` (pre-0.12 / custom) fall back to this
  process's boot-resumed local cache — correct single-process only, matching the
  fallback the write path already uses.
- Pre-1.0 minor bump per 0.x semver. All in-repo callers are updated; external
  callers add one `await`.

### Notes

- The standalone `createIntegrityAudit()` wrapper in `audit-integrity.ts` is
  unchanged and remains **single-process only** — it holds no storage handle to
  read a durable head, and its `stats()` was already `async`.
- Supersedes the 0.18.2 "`stats()` … deferred (it would change the method from
  sync to async)" note — that is now done and tracked here.

## [0.18.2] - 2026-07-15 — Multi-process-safe audit integrity chain

Fixes silent audit-event loss and hash-chain forking when the integrity audit
(`integrityAudit`) runs behind more than one process (e.g. multiple replicas, a
`pm2` cluster, or serverless instances sharing one Postgres database).

Previously the chain's `sequence` and `previousHash` were held as
process-local state, resumed from the durable head only once at boot. Every
process then advanced its own counter independently, so two processes derived
the same sequence for the same org — one `INSERT` won and the other lost to
the `UNIQUE (COALESCE(organization_id,''), integrity_sequence)` index
(Postgres `23505`), dropping that governance decision's tamper-evident record.
Even without a collision the per-process `previousHash` forked the chain.

Sequence allocation and previous-hash derivation are now atomic **against the
database, per org**: the storage adapter reads the current head, derives the
HMAC, and inserts — all under a per-org lock — on every write. No consumer
code change is required beyond upgrading; `createGovernance({ integrityAudit })`
picks up the safe path automatically.

Backward compatible: the canonical hash form, per-org scoping, `verify()`,
`export()`, and `stats()` are unchanged.

### Added

- `GovernanceStorage.appendToAuditChain(event, computeIntegrity)` — atomically
  reads the org's durable head, invokes `computeIntegrity(head)` (the signing
  key stays in the SDK core), and persists event + integrity as one operation.
  Implemented by the memory adapter (per-org async lock) and the Postgres
  adapter.
- Postgres path uses a transaction with
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock(<classid>, hashtext(org))` → head `SELECT` → `INSERT`
  → `COMMIT`, serialising each org's chain against itself across all writers
  (unrelated orgs proceed in parallel). The two-arg lock form namespaces the
  key under a fixed classid so other advisory-lock users of the same database
  can't contend with the audit chain.
- `PgClientLike` type and an optional `connect()` on `PgPoolLike` for the
  transactional path. Pools exposing only `query()` fall back to a bounded
  read-head → insert → retry-on-`23505` loop with jittered backoff, which is
  also multi-writer-safe: every unique-violation means a competitor committed
  the derived sequence, so a writer loses at most once per concurrent same-org
  contender (the retry cap absorbs 12-way same-instant contention).

### Changed

- `createGovernance()` prefers `appendToAuditChain` when the storage adapter
  provides it; the previous `createAuditEventWithIntegrity` + process-local
  sequence path remains only as a fallback for third-party adapters that
  predate this method (correct under a single writer).
- The Postgres chain-head `SELECT` now scopes by `COALESCE(organization_id,'')`
  — the exact partition of the unique index and the advisory-lock key — so the
  head read can never disagree with the uniqueness/lock scope (a literal-`''`
  org and the org-less chain were previously read as different heads while
  colliding on the same index partition). Matching the index expression also
  lets the head read walk the unique index directly.

### Fixed

- `verifyAuditIntegrity()` and `integrityChain.export()` now order entries by
  the HMAC-covered `sequence` (wall-clock `createdAt` only tiebreaks) instead
  of `createdAt`-first. `createdAt` is stamped before the append lock, so
  under concurrent writers a lower sequence can carry a later timestamp
  (lock-wait inversion, cross-process clock skew) — the old ordering could report
  a valid multi-writer chain as tampered. Sequence ordering is tamper-safe:
  the sequence is inside the signed hash, so forging it still breaks the
  hash/previous-hash checks.
- On the transactional append path, a failed `ROLLBACK` now destroys the
  pooled connection (`client.release(err)`) instead of returning a dead or
  aborted-transaction client to the pool.
- `integrityChain.export()` / `verifyAuditIntegrity()` now read durable
  integrity whenever the adapter implements `getAuditIntegrity`, no longer
  gating that read on the legacy `createAuditEventWithIntegrity`. An adapter
  implementing the new `appendToAuditChain` write contract plus
  `getAuditIntegrity` (but not the legacy write method) previously exported an
  empty chain even though its writes persisted integrity durably.
- A storage adapter with durable integrity but no `appendToAuditChain` now
  emits a one-time `onAuditError` advisory: it uses process-local sequence
  allocation, which is multi-process-safe only under a single writer. The
  README's "falls back safely and warns" guidance previously held only for the
  older session-local (no `createAuditEventWithIntegrity`) fallback.

### Notes

- `integrityChain.stats()` still reports this process's last-written sequence
  and hash (a process-local cache), so it can lag another process's writes. The
  durable chain is authoritative; `export()` + `verifyAuditIntegrity()` read
  from storage. A DB-backed `stats()` is deferred (it would change the method
  from sync to async — a breaking signature change); tracked in #39.
- The standalone `createIntegrityAudit()` wrapper in `audit-integrity.ts`
  keeps its chain in process memory and is **single-process only** — it is a
  separate, in-memory construct from the durable
  `createGovernance({ integrityAudit })` path this fix hardens (the wrapper
  holds no storage handle to append against). It now carries a prominent
  single-process warning in its JSDoc and the README "Multi-process
  deployments" note; use `createGovernance({ integrityAudit })` for durable,
  multi-process audit.
- Rolling deploys: the advisory lock only protects writers that take it.
  During a mixed-version window, pre-0.18.2 processes still allocate from
  their process-local counters and can collide with or fork past locked
  writers. Replace all writers together; expect residual unique-violation
  warnings until the last old process drains.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-06-26 — Evasion-resistant injection normalization

Hardens `detectInjection()` against obfuscated prompt-injection attacks that
slipped past keyword patterns, and adds two agent-specific attack patterns.
The detector now folds three more evasion classes back to their plain form
before matching, so an attacker can no longer dodge a rule by spacing out
letters, breaking a word with markdown, or swapping in lookalike characters.

Purely additive — no API changes, no config changes. Existing thresholds and
custom patterns behave exactly as before; the new normalization only widens
what the *same* patterns can see.

On the Lua Injection Benchmark v1 (6,931 samples) this lifts the shipped
regex detector from **781 → 801** true positives (recall 37.26% → 38.22%,
F1 48.27% → 49.19%) for a single additional false positive — precision holds
at ~69% and the false-positive rate is unchanged at ~7.4%.

### Added

- **Confusable (homoglyph) folding** — Cyrillic/Greek lookalikes are mapped to
  their Latin form during normalization (`systеm prоmpt` with Cyrillic `е`/`о`
  → `system prompt`). NFKC does not fold these, so they previously survived
  untouched.
- **Spaced-character collapsing** — `collapseSpacedChars()` rejoins runs of
  4+ single characters split by spaces or `. _ -` (`i g n o r e` → `ignore`),
  replacing the previous single hardcoded pattern. Short runs (initials,
  acronyms like `U S A`) are left intact.
- **Markdown-emphasis stripping** — `stripMarkdownEmphasis()` removes `*`, `_`,
  `~`, and backtick markers attackers insert mid-word (`ig**no**re` → `ignore`).
- Two new built-in patterns (54 → 56): `agent_worm_propagation` (instructions
  that try to spread to other agents) and `forced_tool_call` (tool/function
  selection controls smuggled into free-text input).

### Changed

- The matcher now scans the normalized input plus each obfuscation variant
  (`:leet`, `:despaced`, `:demarkdown`) in one pass; a pattern already matched
  in a cleaner form is not re-counted. Obfuscation-variant hits keep the same
  +0.1 weight nudge that encoded-payload matches already received.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-26 — Per-org (multi-tenant) audit chains

The tamper-evident audit chain is now scoped **per organization**. Before
this release a single `createGovernance({ integrityAudit })` instance kept
one global hash chain, so every org's events were interleaved into the same
chain and sequence space — you couldn't hand one tenant a clean, contiguous,
independently-verifiable export, and one tenant's volume affected another's
chain. Now each `organizationId` gets its own head, its own 1..N sequence,
and its own write lock; events with no org share a single org-less chain,
byte-for-byte compatible with chains written before this release.

Additive and backward-compatible — org-less usage is unchanged.

### Added

- `EnforcementContext.organizationId`, `AgentRegistration.organizationId`,
  `ActionOutcome.organizationId` — supply the tenant to scope its chain.
  `enforce()` / `enforceStage()` also fall back to `metadata.organizationId`.
- `integrityChain.stats(organizationId?)` and `integrityChain.export({ organizationId })`
  now operate on a single org's chain.
- `GovernanceStorage.getChainHead(organizationId?)` — resume the right org's
  chain on restart. The in-memory and Postgres adapters implement it.

### Changed

- `canonicalize()` binds `organizationId` into the per-event hash **only when
  present**, so an event cannot be relabelled into another org's chain without
  detection. Org-less events hash exactly as before (no migration needed).
- Postgres adapter now persists `organization_id` on agents and audit events
  (the columns/indexes already existed but were never written), and the
  `integrity_sequence` unique index is now per-org
  (`(COALESCE(organization_id,''), integrity_sequence)`). The integrity
  migration drops the old global unique index and creates the composite one
  — idempotent, safe on existing rows.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-05-07 — Custom conditions reachable from `createGovernance()`

The condition registry (`registerCondition` / `unregisterCondition` /
`getRegisteredCondition` / `getRegisteredConditions` /
`clearConditionRegistry`) and `PolicyEngineConfig.conditions` were already
on `PolicyEngine` since 0.15, but `GovernanceInstance` (the thing
`createGovernance()` returns) didn't expose them — `instance.policies` is
a `ReadonlyPolicyEngine` view that intentionally hides mutators. So
callers who followed the documented `createGovernance()` flow had no path
to register a custom condition without dropping down to
`createPolicyEngine()` and re-wiring everything else themselves.

This release closes that gap. Additive only — no breaking changes.

### Added — `GovernanceConfig.conditions`

```ts
const gov = createGovernance({
  conditions: [{
    name: "geo_fence",
    description: "Block actions outside allowed regions",
    evaluator: (ctx, params) => /* ... */ false,
  }],
  rules: [/* ... */],
});
```

Forwarded into the underlying `createPolicyEngine` call.

### Added — registry passthroughs on `GovernanceInstance`

Mirroring the existing `addRule` / `removeRule` pattern:

- `gov.registerCondition(entry, opts?)`
- `gov.unregisterCondition(name)`
- `gov.getRegisteredCondition(name)`
- `gov.getRegisteredConditions()`
- `gov.clearConditionRegistry(opts?)`

All thin forwarders to the engine.

### Changed — `GovernanceConfig.defaultOutcome` accepts the full `PolicyOutcome` union

Was `"allow" | "block"`; now matches `PolicyEngineConfig.defaultOutcome`
(`"allow" | "block" | "warn" | "require_approval" | "mask"`). Existing
callers passing `"allow"` or `"block"` are unaffected.

### Docs

README's "Quick Start" section gained a **Custom Conditions** subsection
demonstrating both construction-time (`config.conditions`) and runtime
(`gov.registerCondition()`) registration via `createGovernance()`. The
previous custom-condition example used the lower-level `createPolicyEngine`
which left users on the documented `createGovernance` path stuck.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-30 — Per-policy multi-modal scan dispatch

0.15 introduced `governance-sdk/scan/multi-modal` as a host-callable
orchestrator with a global "scan everything you opt into" shape. That
worked for the SDK plumbing but coupled rules that have nothing to do
with each other (a token-budget rule has no business knowing about
images). 0.16 moves modality config onto the **policy rule itself**.

### Added — `scanModalities` on `PolicyRule`

```ts
const rule: PolicyRule = {
  id: "image-aware-injection-guard",
  name: "Block prompt injection in vision payloads",
  condition: { type: "injection_guard", params: { threshold: 0.5 } },
  outcome: "block",
  reason: "Injection detected in image OCR text",
  priority: 100,
  enabled: true,
  scanModalities: ["text", "image"], // ← new
};
```

Rules opt into modalities individually. Different policies can have
different coverage — a `prompt_injection` rule scoped to text + image,
a `sensitive_data_filter` rule scoped to text + pdf, etc. The host
runs `scanMultiModal()` once for the union and stuffs the per-modality
text into `ctx.textByModality`. Each rule's evaluator pulls the slice
it needs.

### Added — `textByModality` on `EnforcementContext`

```ts
ctx.textByModality = {
  text: "user prompt",
  image: "OCR'd image text",
  pdf: "extracted PDF body",
};
```

Host populates this before calling `enforce()`. Content-scanning
evaluators consult it via `getScanText(ctx, rule)`; metadata-only rules
ignore it entirely.

### Added — `CONDITIONS_SUPPORTING_MODALITIES` registry

Exported from `governance-sdk/scan/multi-modal`. Six condition types
semantically operate on text content and accept `scanModalities`:

| Condition | Operates on |
|---|---|
| `injection_guard` | regex injection detection over input text |
| `ml_injection_guard` | pre-computed ML score (host runs the classifier on the modality union) |
| `blocklist` | term match in input text |
| `input_pattern` | regex over input text |
| `output_pattern` | regex over output text |
| `sensitive_data_filter` | curated patterns over output text |

Everything else — `cost_budget`, `concurrent_limit`, `time_window`,
`tool_blocked`, `agent_level`, `network_allowlist`, `scope_boundary`,
`require_signed_identity`, length checks, combinators themselves —
operates on metadata and ignores `scanModalities` entirely. Cloud UIs
use `conditionSupportsModalities(type)` to decide whether to render a
modality selector for a given rule type.

### Added — `getScanText(ctx, rule)` helper

```ts
import { getScanText } from "governance-sdk";
```

Returns per-modality text slices when the rule opts in (an array of
strings: each modality's text plus a joined cross-modality version
matching `extractStrings`'s shape). Returns `null` to signal "use the
legacy input-walk fallback" — the backward-compat seam for rules that
don't opt in.

### Changed — `ConditionEvaluator` signature

```ts
type ConditionEvaluator = (
  ctx: EnforcementContext,
  params: Record<string, unknown>,
  rule?: PolicyRule, // ← new third arg
) => boolean;
```

Structurally backward compatible — existing `(ctx, params) => boolean`
implementations satisfy the wider signature unchanged. The engine
threads the rule through `evaluate`, `evaluateStage`, and
`evaluateCondition` so evaluators that care about
`rule.scanModalities` can read it.

### Changed — combinators preserve parent's modality scope

`any_of`, `all_of`, and `not` synthesise a per-child rule view that
preserves the parent's `scanModalities` while rebinding `condition`
to the nested type. So an `any_of` over `injection_guard` + `blocklist`
with `scanModalities: ["image"]` correctly scopes both sub-checks to
image-extracted text.

### Migration

Drop-in. Rules without `scanModalities` see exactly the same content
as before — `getScanText` returns null, evaluators fall back to
`extractStrings(ctx.input)` / `ctx.outputText`. The existing 1,399
tests pass unchanged. New behaviour is purely additive.

Hosts wishing to enable multi-modal coverage:
1. Configure the relevant policy rules with `scanModalities`.
2. In your enforce wrapper, call `scanMultiModal(blocks, { enabled })`
   for the union of modalities across active rules.
3. Populate `ctx.textByModality` from the scan result.
4. Call `enforce()` as usual — the engine handles per-rule dispatch.

### Tests

1,413 / 0 (was 1,399 / 0). Fourteen new tests cover the registry, the
helper, per-rule dispatch, multi-rule independence, ignored-on-
metadata-rules safety, and combinator propagation.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-30 — Tool-result scanning across the framework adapters

0.14 wired tool-result scanning into the Mastra processor and MCP adapter
only. 0.15 rolls the same protection out to the four other adapters that
already do tool wrapping at construction time:

- **LangChain** — `tool.invoke` wrap (in both `governTool` and `governTools`)
- **OpenAI Agents** — `tool.invoke` AND `tool.execute` wraps
- **Genkit** — `tool.call` wrap
- **LlamaIndex** — `tool.call` wrap

For each, the wrapped invoke/call/execute now runs the tool's return value
through `scanToolResult()` (the same shared signal-then-enforce helper
the Mastra processor uses) at stage `tool_result` before returning. On
block, a `{ blocked, reason, ruleId }` redacted detail object replaces
the original output, so the LLM never ingests the poisoned content.

### Added — `scanToolResults` config flag on each adapter

```ts
const { tools } = await governLangChainTools(gov, [searchTool], {
  agentName: "my-agent",
  scanToolResults: true,           // default — opt-out via false
  toolResultInjectionThreshold: 0.5,
});
```

Default `true` (matches the Mastra processor default). Existing callers
who upgrade to 0.15 get tool-result scanning automatically; set
`scanToolResults: false` to skip — useful for test environments that
mock tool returns.

### What didn't change

- **Anthropic / Mistral / Ollama** still use a caller-driven
  `handleToolUse` / `handleToolCall` pattern. Tool-result scanning here
  has to be integrated at the call site by the user — the SDK can't
  intercept transparently. Consider using `gov.scanToolResult()` in
  your handler manually.
- **Vercel AI** — no native tool-wrapping path on this adapter today.
  Tracked as a follow-up; for now use `scanOutput` on model output.
- **Bedrock** — entry-gate only; tool execution happens inside AWS,
  no post-execute hook is exposed by Bedrock Agents.
- **Mastra middleware adapter** (`mastra.ts`, not the processor) — uses
  a different wrap shape; coverage to follow.

### Migration

Drop-in. No public type breakage. The new config fields are optional
and additive. Existing tests that mock tool returns may need
`scanToolResults: false` if they don't expect the helper's path engine
to run on their fixtures.

### Added — `governance-sdk/scan/multi-modal` (opt-in)

Closes the bypass where image, PDF, and audio content blocks pass through
`enforce()` unscanned. Ships orchestration only — actual OCR / PDF parsing
/ ASR are caller-supplied via a registry pattern, preserving the zero-
runtime-dep promise. Mirrors the `InjectionClassifier` shape: pluggable
async scanner + global registry + pre-`enforce()` invocation.

```ts
import {
  registerModalityScanner,
  scanMultiModal,
  isFailClosed,
} from 'governance-sdk/scan/multi-modal';

registerModalityScanner('image', {
  extractText: async (block) => await ocrEngine.recognize(block),
});

const scan = await scanMultiModal(blocks, {
  enabled: ['text', 'image'],
  onMissingScanner: 'block',
  onExtractError: 'block',
  timeoutMs: 5_000,
});

if (scan.failClosed) { /* block before enforce() */ }
// otherwise: feed scan.text into the existing detectInjection / hybridDetect
```

Conservative defaults — every modality except `text` is OFF until the
caller opts in. `onMissingScanner` / `onExtractError` default to `'skip'`;
`timeoutMs` defaults to 30s per block.

`result.failClosed` is pre-evaluated against the policy passed in —
trust it directly. `isFailClosed(result, override?)` is available for
callers wanting to apply a different policy after the fact (defaults to
`result.policy` when no override is given).

Failure modes recorded in `result.blocked[]`:
- `no_scanner` — enabled modality with no extractor registered.
- `extract_error` — scanner threw, rejected, or returned a non-string.
- `extract_timeout` — scanner exceeded `timeoutMs`.

Scanner returning `null` is the documented benign signal "this block has
no extractable text" (e.g. a purely visual image). Recorded in
`result.modalitiesEmpty[]`, NOT `blocked[]`, and never triggers fail-
closed regardless of policy.

### Changed — README honesty pass

- 12 framework integrations (was undercounted as "10")
- 47 export paths (was "44")
- 1,340 tests (was "1,328")
- Plugin export list now lists all 16 paths — previously omitted
  `mcp-allowlist` and `mcp-call-recorder`
- Tamper-evident HMAC audit chain promoted from a body-text mention to a
  hero-section callout (it's a real competitive differentiator)
- Sandboxing reframed: leads with "Process isolation is the security
  model" instead of "No sandbox," same disclaimer scoped as a deliberate
  choice rather than a gap
- "What this is NOT" → "Limitations & Honest Scope"

## [0.14.1] - 2026-04-30 — Field extraction on the `process` stage

`scope_boundary` and `network_allowlist` rules at stage `process` (the
default for those conditions, where pre-execution blocking happens)
silently never fired on tool calls today — `evaluateToolCall` (the path
behind `processOutputStep`) didn't populate `ctx.targetPath` /
`ctx.targetUrl`, and those conditions read those fields exclusively.

0.14.0 wired the field-extraction registry into `wrapTool` (tool_result
stage). 0.14.1 wires it into `evaluateToolCall` too — same registry, same
generic name conventions (`path` / `filePath` / `url` / `href` / ...).
With this fix:

```yaml
- id: block-etc
  condition: { type: scope_boundary, params: { blockedPaths: ["/etc/**"] } }
  outcome: block
  stage: process
```

…now actually blocks `device__lua_desktop__read_file({ path: "/etc/passwd" })`
*before* Desktop runs the read, instead of falling through silently.

### Tests

1,372 tests, 0 failures (+2 — scope_boundary fires on `args.path`,
network_allowlist fires on `args.url`, both at stage process).

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-30 — `tool_result` stage + `wrapTool` helper

Closes the framework gap where tool-call return content (file contents,
clipboard text, scraped pages, MCP returns) reached the LLM unscanned on
every Mastra agent. The Mastra processor lifecycle has no hook between a
tool's `execute()` returning and the next LLM call — scanning has to
happen inside the tool's execute. The new `wrapTool` / `wrapTools`
methods on `GovernanceProcessor` close that gap at construction time.

### Added — `"tool_result"` PolicyStage

Four stages now: `preprocess` → `process` → `tool_result` → `postprocess`.

```ts
export type PolicyStage = "preprocess" | "process" | "tool_result" | "postprocess";
```

`tool_result` is structurally distinct from `postprocess`:
- **postprocess** — agent's final output to the user. Threat: agent leaks
  credentials/PII. Default conditions: `output_pattern`, `output_length`,
  `sensitive_data_filter`.
- **tool_result** — content a tool returned, before the LLM ingests it on
  the next turn. Threat: external content carries prompt injection that
  poisons the LLM context. Default condition: `ml_injection_guard`.

Existing rules continue to fire at their original stage. Only condition
*defaults* shifted (`ml_injection_guard` → `tool_result`); explicit
`stage:` on a rule always wins.

### Added — `governance.enforceToolResult(ctx)`

Symmetric with `enforcePreprocess` / `enforcePostprocess`. Evaluates only
rules at the `tool_result` stage.

### Added — `scanToolResult()` helper (signal-then-enforce)

```ts
import { scanToolResult } from "governance-sdk";

const { result, blocked, decision } = await scanToolResult({
  governance: gov,
  agentId, tool, args, result: toolReturnValue,
  fields: { targetPath: "/path/from/args" }, // optional, enables scope_boundary
});
```

The helper does the orchestration: extracts scannable text from any
return shape, runs `detectInjection()` to populate
`ctx.mlInjectionScore`, calls the engine at `stage: "tool_result"`,
substitutes a redacted `BlockedToolResult` on block.

**Pattern: `detectInjection` is never a decision-maker.** It's a signal
generator. The policy engine — evaluating every applicable rule with all
its composites and priority — is always the sole decision-maker, in both
local mode (engine in-process) and cloud mode (engine via `enforce()`
HTTP).

### Added — `GovernanceProcessor.wrapTool` / `wrapTools`

The Mastra adapter for the helper above. Wrap individual tools or a tools
dict before handing to a Mastra `Agent`:

```ts
const agent = new Agent({
  tools: processor.wrapTools({ read_file, write_file, take_screenshot }),
  ...
});
```

Wrapped tools' `execute()` runs the original, scans the result, returns
either the original (allow) or a redacted `{ blocked, reason, ruleId }`
(block / require_approval). The LLM sees the redacted detail and adapts
naturally on its next turn.

Config flags on `GovernanceProcessorConfig`:
- `scanToolResults` — master switch, default `true`
- `toolResultScans: { [name]: "always" | "never" }` — per-tool override
- `toolResultInjectionThreshold` — local detection threshold, default 0.5
- `toolFieldExtraction` — per-tool registry mapping arg names to context
  fields (e.g. `{ "read_file": { path: "targetPath" } }`). Generic
  defaults cover `path`/`filePath`/`url`/`href`/`uri`/`endpoint`.

### Added — `toolFieldExtraction` registry (closes Gap B)

Without field extraction, rules like
`scope_boundary: { allowedPaths: ["/project/**"] }` silently never fire
— the engine reads `ctx.targetPath`, not raw `args.path`. The new
registry copies fields off the tool's input args onto the right
`EnforcementContext` fields before `enforce()` runs. Same registry feeds
both pre-call (`processOutputStep`) and post-call (`wrapTool`) scans.

### Changed — MCP adapter delegates to the policy engine

The MCP plugin's tool-output scan previously ran `detectInjection()`
inline and threw on detection — bypassing the policy engine. As of 0.14
it calls `scanToolResult()`, giving rule authors composite power
(`sensitive_data_filter`, `output_pattern`, `scope_boundary`,
`require_approval` outcomes, kill switch) on tool-output content.

**Behaviour change:** the block reason now comes from the matched rule
rather than a hard-coded "Injection detected (score: X)". Existing
behaviour is preserved for orgs whose rules look like the old default
(threshold 0.6, `outcome: block`) — but new rules can layer on PII
masking, path scope checks, or LLM-judge overrides on the same scan.

### Changed — default stage for `ml_injection_guard`

Previously unmapped (fell through to `process`). Now defaults to
`tool_result`. Rules with an explicit `stage:` are unaffected; rules
without one and using `ml_injection_guard` will now run at the new
stage. To preserve old behaviour, add `stage: "process"` to the rule.

### Tests

1,370 tests, 0 failures (+30 new tests covering `scanToolResult`,
`wrapTool` / `wrapTools`, field extraction, MCP cleanup behaviour).

### Roadmap (0.15+)

- `trigger_payload` stage for sibling treatment of framework triggers
  (e.g. Desktop's `selection_changed`, `app_focused`).
- Approval persistence — `decision: "always_allow" | "allow_once" |
  "always_block" | "deny_once"` on the approval response, mutating
  policy YAML or cloud rules so subsequent matching calls don't re-ask.
- Clone `wrapTool` / field-extraction shape into the Vercel AI SDK,
  LangChain, and OpenAI Agents adapters.

### Mastra core upstream (parallel)

A `processToolResult?(args)` lifecycle method has been proposed for the
Mastra `Processor` interface. If accepted, `wrapTool` becomes the
backwards-compat shim for older Mastra versions; both paths call the
same `governance.processToolResult(ctx)` core method, so users see no
disruption when the upstream hook lands.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-16 — Conventions flip + deprecation notices

Follow-up to 0.12. Two small, deliberate changes that the 0.12 roadmap
promised — committed now so users have runtime notice before 1.0.

### Changed — OTel `conventions` default flips from `"both"` to `"gen_ai"`

`createOtelHooks()` now defaults to emitting only the GenAI semantic
conventions. Governance spans correlate out of the box with Anthropic,
OpenAI, and Vercel-AI SDK spans in Honeycomb / Datadog / New Relic when
you ingest them through the same tracer.

**Migration.** If your dashboards query the legacy `governance.*`
operation names (`governance.enforcement`, `governance.audit`, etc.),
set `conventions: "both"` explicitly:

```ts
createOtelHooks({ conventions: "both" });
```

This keeps the old op names alongside the new `gen_ai.*` attributes,
same as the 0.12 default. `conventions: "governance"` disables GenAI
emission entirely for customers who cannot adopt the spec yet.

### Changed — `createMCPTrustRegistry` and `createChainAuditor` now warn

Both of these names misrepresented what the functions do. The honest
names (`createMCPAllowlist` and `createMCPCallRecorder`) shipped in
0.12 as path re-exports, and 0.13 adds a one-shot `console.warn` when
the old names are called so you see the nudge at runtime, once per
process.

- `createMCPTrustRegistry` → rename to `createMCPAllowlist`
  (path: `governance-sdk/plugins/mcp-allowlist`)
- `createChainAuditor` → rename to `createMCPCallRecorder`
  (path: `governance-sdk/plugins/mcp-call-recorder`)

Removal is scheduled for 1.0. Behaviour is identical across both
names — the internals were refactored into a shared `buildAllowlist` /
`buildCallRecorder` so the honest names call the core directly and
don't trigger the deprecation path.

### Tests

1,340 tests, 0 failures (up from 1,337 — three new tests pinning the
0.13 OTel default).

### Roadmap (0.14+)

Unchanged from the 0.12 CHANGELOG:
- Multi-modal input scanning (image / PDF / audio) on Anthropic /
  Vercel AI / Bedrock / Genkit / LlamaIndex.
- Signed compliance evidence export (EU AI Act + NIST AI RMF).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-16 — Trust hardening

Closes the three most load-bearing honesty gaps surfaced by the post-0.11
audit. Theme: the things the SDK already claims must actually hold up under
restart, real observability, and real naming.

### Changed — integrity audit chain is now durable (BREAKING-ISH)

Before 0.12, `integrityAudit: { signingKey }` maintained chain state
(latest hash, sequence, per-event integrity) in a `createGovernance()`
closure. Process restart reset the chain to genesis and every event in
Postgres lost its integrity metadata because the write path never touched
the `integrity_*` columns the schema already defined.

**What changed:**
- `GovernanceStorage` gained three optional methods —
  `createAuditEventWithIntegrity(event, integrity)`, `getChainHead()`,
  `getAuditIntegrity(eventId)`. Memory and Postgres adapters implement
  all three.
- `createGovernance()` now writes the event and its integrity metadata
  in a single `INSERT` when the storage adapter is integrity-aware, and
  resumes the chain from `getChainHead()` on boot. Kill the process
  mid-stream, boot a fresh instance, and `integrityChain.stats()`
  returns the pre-crash sequence; `verifyAuditIntegrity()` passes across
  the restart boundary.
- Third-party storage adapters written against the 0.11 interface still
  work. They fall back to the old in-process integrity map and emit an
  `onAuditError` notice explaining the chain is session-local on that
  adapter.

**Schema:** the base `getSchemaSQL()` now creates the integrity columns
on fresh tables; the existing `getIntegrityMigrationSQL()` remains for
0.11.x tables. Both paths are idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`,
`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`). `integrity_sequence` widened from `INTEGER`
to `BIGINT`. A `UNIQUE` index on `integrity_sequence` enforces no
duplicate sequences even under concurrent writers.

**Honesty update:** the "What this is NOT" section in the README was
rewritten to state what HMAC chains prove and don't prove. No more
"tamper-evident" without the caveat.

### Changed — OTel GenAI semantic conventions

`createOtelHooks()` gained a `conventions: "governance" | "gen_ai" | "both"`
option. `"both"` (the 0.12 default) is additive: existing `governance.*`
attributes and operation names still emit, and `gen_ai.system`,
`gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` /
`gen_ai.usage.output_tokens`, `gen_ai.response.finish_reasons`,
`gen_ai.tool.name`, `gen_ai.tool.call.id` appear alongside when present
in the event detail. `"gen_ai"` switches operation names to the GenAI
form (`gen_ai.policy.evaluate`, `gen_ai.tool.execute`,
`gen_ai.agent.register`, `gen_ai.audit.log`) so governance spans can
correlate with Anthropic / OpenAI / Vercel-AI SDK spans in Honeycomb /
Datadog / New Relic. The default flips to `"gen_ai"` in 0.13.

### Changed — honest naming for MCP plugins

`createMCPTrustRegistry` is a URI allowlist, not a cryptographic trust
registry; `createChainAuditor` records caller-reported MCP calls, not
auto-propagated sub-calls. Both are now also exported under honest
names:

- `createMCPAllowlist` (new export path:
  `governance-sdk/plugins/mcp-allowlist`)
- `createMCPCallRecorder` (new export path:
  `governance-sdk/plugins/mcp-call-recorder`)

The original exports stay at their original paths and behave
identically. Rename on your next touch of the file; no rush.

### Fixed — remote status staleness after 4xx errors

`createRemoteEnforcer().status()` flipped `connected: false` whenever
the last `enforce()` call threw a `RemoteEnforcementError`, even on a
non-retryable 4xx. A 4xx means the API answered us — the connection is
fine. Status now stays `connected: true` through API-layer errors and
only reports `connected: false` on a network/timeout failure.

### Roadmap (0.13+)

Not in this release; on the roadmap:
- Shipped ML injection classifier as an opt-in peer-dep package.
- Multi-modal input scanning (image / PDF / audio) on Anthropic / Vercel
  AI / Genkit / LlamaIndex / Bedrock.
- Compliance evidence export (signed, dated dossiers).

## [0.11.2] - 2026-04-16 — Automate README sync

Adds infrastructure to prevent the npm README from drifting out of sync
with the repo-root README again:

- New `scripts/sync-readme.mjs` — generates `packages/governance/README.md`
  from the root `README.md`, normalizing repo-relative links to absolute
  GitHub URLs so they resolve on npmjs.com. Idempotent.
- Wired into `prepublishOnly` so every npm release ships an in-sync README
  automatically.
- New `npm run sync-readme` at the monorepo root for manual runs.
- CI guard added to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — fails the build if anyone
  commits a manual edit to the package README without running the sync.

No code changes. SDK behavior identical to 0.11.1.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-04-16 — Sync npm README with repo

The `packages/governance/README.md` (the file npm publishes) had drifted ~3
release cycles behind the repo-root README. This patch syncs the two so
npm users see the same content GitHub viewers see — including the "What
this is NOT" scope disclosures, the 0.11 module removals, and the
behavioral-scorer demotion. Relative links normalized to absolute GitHub
URLs so they resolve correctly when read on npmjs.com.

No code changes. SDK behavior identical to 0.11.0.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-15 — Scope honesty pass 2

This release follows up the 0.10 cleanup with another round of cuts based on
a feature-by-feature audit against actual `governance-cloud` consumers and
the major competitors (Microsoft `agent-governance-toolkit`, NeMo Guardrails,
Phoenix, Langfuse, Braintrust). Removes 5 modules with no consumers and no
competitor treating them as load-bearing features, and clarifies framing
around 4 more that ship but were oversold as built-in observability / eval
infrastructure. **1,328 tests** pass with **0 failures**.

### Removed (BREAKING)

- **`governance-sdk/eval-trace`**, **`governance-sdk/eval-scorer`**,
  **`governance-sdk/eval-types`**, and the **`gov.eval`** field on
  `GovernanceInstance`. The in-memory trace ring buffer + naive
  eval-adjustment scoring loop was unused by every audited consumer and
  easily mistaken for a real eval pipeline. Use a dedicated harness
  (inspect-ai, PyRIT, Garak, Phoenix, Langfuse, Braintrust) and route
  results to your audit stream via `gov.audit.log()`.
- **`governance-sdk/plugins/mcp-annotations`** — annotation-rule generator
  was a static template, not a runtime governance feature.
- **`governance-sdk/supply-chain-sbom`** — proprietary `LuaAgentSBOM`
  capability manifest with no producers or consumers. The CycloneDX
  exporter (`governance-sdk/supply-chain-cyclonedx`) and the supply-chain
  policy primitive (`governance-sdk/supply-chain`) remain.
- **`GovernMCPConfig.traceCollector`** field — removed alongside `gov.eval`.
  Tool-call audit events still fire via `gov.audit`.

### Demoted (no API change — README framing only)

- **`metrics`**, **`otel-hooks`**, **`action-recorder`**,
  **`behavioral-scorer`** — remain shipped, but no longer headlined as
  built-in observability / eval / dynamic-trust features. A real OTel +
  OpenInference exporter and a TrustEngine promotion of behavioral
  scoring are on the roadmap.

### Migration

- `gov.eval.submit(...)` callers: stop calling. Eval results should land
  in your existing audit stream or your harness's own store.
- `import { generateAgentSBOM } from 'governance-sdk/supply-chain-sbom'`:
  if you need an SBOM, use `governance-sdk/supply-chain-cyclonedx` instead
  (CycloneDX 1.5, validates against the official schema).
- `import { generateAnnotationRules } from 'governance-sdk/plugins/mcp-annotations'`:
  no replacement; build annotation-aware rules directly with `policy-builder`
  or `policy-yaml`.
- `traceCollector` in `createGovernedMCP(...)` config: drop the field.

### Stats

- 49 → **44** export paths
- 1,358 → **1,328** tests (drop of 30 from removed test files)
- 0 runtime dependencies (unchanged)

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-15 — Scope honesty release

This release tightens the SDK to the surface we can defend, and is honest
about everything it doesn't do. No new features. The remaining
**1,348 tests** pass with **0 failures**.

### Removed (BREAKING)

- **`governance-sdk/federation`** — was advisory-only posture exchange
  with no distributed protocol or signature enforcement. Cross-cluster
  policy replication and signed posture exchange live in Lua Governance
  Cloud.
- **`governance-sdk/sandbox`** — was a `node:vm` wrapper. `node:vm` is
  not a security boundary (per Node docs; see CVE-2023-32002-class
  escapes). Use OS-level isolation (containers, gVisor, Firecracker)
  for untrusted code. Action-gating is still available as ordinary
  policy rules.
- **`governance-sdk/eval-red-team`** and **`gov.eval.runRedTeam(...)`** —
  was a policy-effectiveness audit, not adversarial jailbreak testing.
  Use a dedicated harness (inspect-ai, PyRIT, Garak) and submit results
  via `gov.eval.submit(...)`.
- **`packages/governance-benchmark`** moved to `research/governance-benchmark/`
  and marked private. It is a research artifact (dataset + harness with
  no shipped ML model) and was never published to npm in shippable form.

### Renamed (additive — old names still work for one minor)

- `dryRun` → **`simulatePolicy`** (preferred)
- `fleetDryRun` → **`simulateFleetPolicy`** (preferred)
- `assessCompliance` → **`mapToEuAiAct`** (preferred), matching
  the existing `mapToIso42001` / `mapToNistAiRmf` / `mapToOwaspAgentic`.

### Documentation

- New **"What this is NOT"** section in the SDK README that pre-empts
  scope questions: kill switch is per-process, sandbox is gone,
  injection F1 ≈ 0.48, compliance mapping is self-assessment, SBOM is
  npm-only, eval is in-memory, simulator does not replay side effects,
  `enforce()` does not hash-chain by default, cloud `register()` is
  a synthetic confirmation, federation lives in Cloud.
- Fixed pattern-count drift: README now says **54 patterns** (matching
  the source files and the published baseline), not "64+".
- Benchmark README now reports the **actual baseline numbers**
  (precision 0.685, recall 0.373, F1 0.483, FP rate 0.074) rather than
  aspirational "≥85%" pass thresholds.
- Clarified scope in `supply-chain.ts` JSDoc: this is allowlist
  validation, not provenance / SLSA / signatures.
- Clarified `remote-enforce.ts` `register()` returns a synthetic
  confirmation; the API auto-registers on first `enforce()`.
- Clarified that `enforce()` writes audit events un-chained by default;
  use `createIntegrityAudit()` for tamper-evident audit.

### Migration

- If you imported from `governance-sdk/federation`, `governance-sdk/sandbox`,
  or `governance-sdk/eval-red-team` — those subpaths are gone. Federation
  + signed posture exchange is in Lua Governance Cloud. Sandbox: use
  OS-level isolation. Red team: use inspect-ai / PyRIT / Garak.
- If you called `gov.eval.runRedTeam(...)`, it no longer exists. Submit
  results from your own harness via `gov.eval.submit(...)`.
- If you used `dryRun` / `fleetDryRun` / `assessCompliance`, those still
  work — but `simulatePolicy` / `simulateFleetPolicy` / `mapToEuAiAct`
  are the preferred names going forward.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added — full LLM lifecycle coverage across all featured adapters

Every featured adapter now supports **pre-scan on user input**, **post-scan
on model output**, **streaming post-scan** (buffered / sliding / per-chunk),
and **tool-call enforcement**. Shared pre/post + streaming helpers live in
`src/plugins/pre-post-enforce.ts` and `src/plugins/pre-post-stream.ts`.

New exports per adapter:

- **Vercel AI SDK** — `createGovernanceMiddleware` now returns a middleware
  implementing `transformParams` (pre), `wrapGenerate` (post), `wrapStream`
  (streaming post). Config accepts `streamMode`, `streamLookbackChunks`,
  `streamLookbackChars`.
- **Anthropic SDK** — `createGovernedMessages` (wraps `messages.create`),
  `createGovernedMessageStream` (wraps `messages.stream`).
- **LangChain** — `wrapChatModel` overrides `.invoke()` and `.stream()` with
  governance pre/post enforcement. Prototype-preserving.
- **OpenAI Agents SDK** — `createInputGuardrail`, `createOutputGuardrail`
  produce SDK-native guardrail objects. Streaming post-scan is SDK-native
  (fires at final assembly).
- **Mastra Processor** — implements the previously-TODO'd
  `processOutputStream` Mastra lifecycle hook with per-chunk / sliding /
  buffered modes.
- **Mastra middleware** — now exposes `scanInput`, `scanOutput`,
  `scanOutputStream` helpers for explicit pre/post scanning from a custom
  runtime loop.
- **Genkit** — `createGovernedGenerate`, `createGovernedGenerateStream`
  wrap `ai.generate` and `ai.generateStream`.
- **LlamaIndex** — `wrapLlamaLLM` wraps any LLM implementing
  `chat({ messages, stream? })`. Covers non-streaming and streaming paths.
- **Mistral** — `createGovernedChat`, `createGovernedChatStream` wrap
  `chat.complete` and `chat.stream`.
- **Ollama** — `createGovernedOllamaChat`, `createGovernedOllamaChatStream`
  wrap `ollama.chat` in both shapes.
- **MCP** — added symmetric input injection scan on tool-call arguments
  (`scanToolInputs`, `inputInjectionThreshold`) to match the existing
  output scan.
- **Bedrock** — entry-gate pre-scan on `invokeAgent` input + `scanOutput`
  helper for post-scan after the caller drains the streamed response.
  Internal tool calls inside a Bedrock Agent run remain opaque (server-side
  inside AWS).

### Removed

Dropped 8 adapter stubs that didn't meaningfully govern anything:

- `plugins/crewai`, `plugins/autogen`, `plugins/semantic-kernel` — primarily
  Python / C# frameworks; the JS stubs don't map onto the real agent
  runtimes. Python support is via the Lua Governance REST API.
- `plugins/a2a` — inter-agent message protocol, not a tool-call surface.
- `plugins/e2b` — sandbox governance is an AppArmor/seccomp-layer problem,
  not a policy-over-tool-calls problem.
- `plugins/deno`, `plugins/cloudflare-ai` — runtimes / raw model invocation,
  not agent frameworks. The SDK already works in those runtimes without a
  specific adapter.
- `plugins/composio` — redundant; govern at the agent framework layer that
  consumes Composio tools.

The corresponding `package.json` subpath exports, peer dependencies, and
`peerDependenciesMeta` entries have been removed. The previously-public
barrel re-exports `GovernanceBlockedError` and `GovernanceApprovalRequiredError`
remain available from every featured adapter.

### Changed

READMEs refactored to a single **Featured** tier (10 adapters) and a
**Specialty** tier (MCP, Bedrock) with honest scope framing. The prior
"20 adapters" marketing claim is retired.

### Breaking — drop Node 18 support

`engines.node` bumped from `>=18` to `>=20`. Node 18 reached end-of-life
in April 2025 and several existing tests (Ed25519 agent identity,
audit-integrity HMAC chain, agent-identity tokens) require crypto
primitives that aren't reliable on Node 18. CI matrix is now
`[20, 22, 24]`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-07

### Added — Mastra Processor: full lifecycle coverage

The `GovernanceProcessor` plugin (`governance-sdk/plugins/mastra-processor`)
now implements three Mastra processor lifecycle methods. Previously it only
implemented `processOutputStep` (tool-call enforcement). A single processor
instance now covers the entire pipeline:

- **`processInput()`** — runs once before the LLM is invoked. Calls
  `governance.enforcePreprocess()` on the latest user message. This is
  where injection scanning, input blocklists, input length, and any other
  PRE-stage rules fire.
- **`processOutputStep()`** — unchanged. Runs after each LLM response,
  intercepting tool calls before execution. Calls `governance.enforce()`.
- **`processOutputResult()`** — runs once after the agent finishes
  generating, with the resolved final result. Calls
  `governance.enforcePostprocess()` on the agent's response text. This is
  where output filtering, PII redaction, and sensitive-data masking fire.
  On `outcome: 'mask'`, the latest assistant message is mutated in place
  with the SDK-computed `maskedText`.

All three methods call the SDK's public enforce APIs, which means a single
processor works in **both local mode** (in-process policy evaluation) and
**remote mode** (HTTP enforce against the governance cloud). The integrator
controls the transport via `createGovernance({ serverUrl, apiKey })`.

### Added — Per-call metadata enrichment

`GovernanceProcessorConfig` now accepts a `metadataProvider` callback that
runs once per enforce invocation (preprocess, tool call, postprocess) and
returns an object merged into `EnforcementContext.metadata`. The merged
metadata is serialized into the cloud HTTP body and persisted on every
audit event and approval queue entry.

```typescript
new GovernanceProcessor(gov, {
  agentName: 'my-agent',
  owner: 'my-team',
  metadataProvider: (stage, args) => {
    // For Mastra, args.requestContext is the canonical place to read
    // per-request data (userId, channel, threadId, etc.)
    const ctx = args.requestContext;
    return {
      stage,
      userId: ctx?.get('userId'),
      channel: ctx?.get('channel'),
      threadId: ctx?.get('threadId'),
    };
  },
});
```

A `metadata` (static, applied to every call) field is also accepted; per-call
values from `metadataProvider` take precedence on key conflicts.

### Added — Lifecycle-specific config flags

- `skipPreprocess?: boolean` — bypass `processInput` enforcement entirely
- `skipPostprocess?: boolean` — bypass `processOutputResult` enforcement entirely

Both default to `false`. Useful for legacy migration paths and for replay
flows where governance has already approved the call out-of-band.

### Added — Lifecycle-specific callbacks

- `onPreprocessBlocked?: (decision, message) => void` — fired when a
  preprocess rule blocks an inbound user message
- `onPostprocessBlocked?: (decision, output) => void` — fired when a
  postprocess rule blocks the agent's output
- `onApprovalRequired?: (decision, stage) => void` — fired when any stage
  returns `outcome: require_approval`. The `stage` parameter is one of
  `'preprocess' | 'tool_call' | 'postprocess'`
- `onMask?: (decision, original, masked) => void` — fired when a postprocess
  rule returns `outcome: mask`, with both the original text and the
  SDK-computed redacted version

### Added — Type exports

New types exported from `governance-sdk/plugins/mastra-processor`:

- `ProcessInputArgs` — Mastra `processInput` argument shape (mirror)
- `ProcessOutputResultArgs` — Mastra `processOutputResult` argument shape (mirror)
- `MastraOutputResult` — final generation result shape (mirror)
- `GovernanceLifecycleArgs` — union of all argument shapes for `metadataProvider`
- `GovernanceStage` — `'preprocess' | 'tool_call' | 'postprocess'`

### Backwards compatibility

This is an **additive** release. Existing consumers using only
`processOutputStep` see no behavior change — Mastra only calls the new
lifecycle methods if they're implemented, and the implementations are
gated on the new `skipPreprocess` / `skipPostprocess` flags as well as
fail-open if the agent isn't yet registered.

The existing tool-call EnforcementContext now includes any
`metadataProvider` output as well; this is additive — previously the
metadata field was empty.

### Tests

14 new tests covering all new lifecycle methods, metadata threading,
async metadataProvider promise handling, structured-content text
extraction, mask outcome message mutation, skip flags, and the
fail-open paths. Test count: 1201 → 1215.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-02

### Changed
- **Renamed to `governance-sdk`** — unscoped npm package for maximum discoverability
- Package: `@lua-ai-global/governance` → `governance-sdk`
