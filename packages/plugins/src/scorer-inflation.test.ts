/**
 * Score inflation adversarial tests.
 *
 * The 7-dimension scorer accepts self-reported booleans (`hasAuth`,
 * `hasGuardrails`, `hasObservability`, `hasAuditLog`). An agent CAN claim
 * all four are `true` with zero supporting code — if you don't cross-check
 * against the repo, you're scoring a checkbox questionnaire, not reality.
 *
 * These tests document the risk and show the cross-check pattern using
 * `scanRepoContents`, which reads actual source and reports per-capability
 * detection + confidence.
