/**
 * Scanner plugin types.
 *
 * Scanner plugins are framework-specific extensions to the generic repo
 * scanner. The core scanner handles language-agnostic concerns (import
 * parsing, capability detection) and delegates framework-specific work
 * (what counts as a "tool", how to expand a "skill container" into its
 * child tools) to plugins.
 *
 * A plugin is pure data + pure functions. Any I/O (fetching remote files
 * to expand a skill) is done by the caller via a `FileResolver` callback,
 * keeping the SDK zero-I/O.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { scanRepoContents } from "@governance-sdk/core";
 * import { luaScannerPlugin } from "@governance-sdk/core/scanner-plugins/lua";
 *
 * const result = await scanRepoContents(fileContents, {
 *   plugins: [luaScannerPlugin],
 *   resolveFile: async (specifier) => {
 *     // caller fetches source for `@lua-agents/crm/skills/dealSkill`
 *     // from GitHub / disk / wherever and returns the source string.
 *     return fetchFromGithub(specifier);
 *   },
 * });
 * ```

 *
 *   1. **Ownership** — `ownsImport` returns true if this plugin knows
 *      how to handle a given import specifier. E.g. the Lua plugin
 *      claims imports from `@lua-agents/*`.
 *
 *   2. **Expansion** — `expandTools` takes a resolved source string and
 *      returns the concrete tool names it defines. For Lua this means
 *      finding `implements LuaTool { name = "..." }` classes inside a
 *      skill file and returning their names.
 *
 * A plugin may *also* expose a `detectFramework` function that inspects
 * scanned file contents to decide whether the current repo belongs to
 * this framework. This lets the core scanner pick the right plugin
 * automatically when multiple are registered.
